                                    <br><h3>Who will be teaching?</h3>
                                    <p> Teachers include doctors, engineers and talented final-year medical students. All have extensive medical teaching experience and up-to-date Working with Children licenses.</p>
                                    <br><h3>What does the fee cover? </h3>
                                    <p>The fee covers all teaching staff and guidance, teaching material, venue hire and food and drink on all days. A proportion of the fees paid will contribute to scholarships for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>
                                    <br><h3>Will this program help me get into medicine?</h3>
                                    <p>Yes. To succeed in medical school interviews, you need to have a rich range of experiences in the healthcare space to share with interviewers that demonstrate your passion and how unique you are. Many students fail interviews because they have few meaningful experiences to share that allow them to stand out or show their passion. During the program, you will learn how to think like a medical doctor and an innovative healthcare leader, which is invaluable for interviews (and no other program exists like it in Melbourne). We have also dedicated a time in the program for fellows to receive advice from recent medical entrants and our teaching staff, which will assist them in the interview, UCAT/GAMSAT and application process.</p>
                                    <br><h3>What will you cover in the program? </h3>
                                    <p>We will cover a broad range of technical topics, including clinical medicine (anatomy, physiology, diseases, clinical skills, medical ethics), public health (health economics, preventative healthcare, health systems) and medical technology (medical devices, biotechnology, digital health, healthcare operations). These will form the foundation for a group project and presentation which will teach students how to think and solve healthcare issues and present these ideas to an expert audience. Classes are a mixture of lectures and hands-on workshops.</p>
                                    <br><h3>What support will be provided after the program? </h3>
                                    <p>Nightingale Fellows will join an alumni network that aims to connect future Australian innovators, which will have exclusive access to teaching opportunities, new programs, tips and tricks and healthcare jobs.</p>

                                    <br><h3>When/Where will the program be held?</h3>
                                    <p>The program will be held in Docklands, Victoria from Monday 29th of June to Thursday 9th of July. Classes will be held Monday to Thursday 9am - 4pm (no classes on Friday). </p>
                                    <br><h3>Will food be provided?</h3>
                                    <p>Yes. A light morning tea and lunch will be provided for participants every day, including for those with special dietary requirements. On the last day, this will be extended to canap√©s and light refreshments for attendees of the presentation and graduation ceremony.</p>
                                    <br><h3>Can I attend only part of the program? </h3>
                                    <p>Unfortunately, fellows are expected to attend the entire program. Because the program covers a lot of ground within 8 days, it can be difficult to catch up and contribute meaningfully to the final project if you miss more than 2 days of classes. If you anticipate that you will be away for more than 2 days, we would recommend applying for the Summer 2021 program. Classes will only run from Monday to Thursday (no classes on Friday).</p>
                                    <br><h3>Will you have more programs in the future?</h3>
                                    <p>Yes! As there is quite a lot to learn in this area, we are developing new medical programs and we expect that no new program will be identical to previous ones. At this stage, we are developing a new medical fellowship for Summer 2021, which will cover a different area of clinical medicine and present a fresh, new challenge for Fellows. We are also currently looking to expand into programs for university students with more advanced content and across different disciplines in the coming years.</p>

                                    <br><h3>What is the application process? </h3>
                                    <p>Students are asked to fill out a form that asks for some basic information and 3 short-answer questions, so that we can get a better idea of who you are and how you think. No references, school reports or interviews are required. The application is due on the 30th of April 2020 at 11:59pm. Late applications will not be considered.</p>
                                    <br><p>The questions can be tricky and we recommend starting early to give yourself enough time to think about them. It could also help to bounce ideas off your family and friends, but we want the answer to be written only by you.</p>
                                    <br><h3>What type of candidate are you looking for?</h3>
                                    <p>We are seeking candidates with a high potential to contribute meaningfully to the future of medicine and a capacity to think creatively about important healthcare issues and potential solutions. If you are passionate about improving healthcare and really want to learn how to do so, we would love to hear from you.</p>
                                    <br><h3>Is this program only for students aspiring to become medical doctors? </h3>
                                    <p>Whilst we expect a certain proportion of participants to have a strong interest in clinical medicine or surgery as a career, the field of medicine is driven by individuals from extremely diverse backgrounds - nurses, biologists, engineers, economists, physiotherapists, pharmacists, artists, lawyers, managers and so on. Understanding clinical knowledge and how doctors think is useful for many occupations!</p>

                                    <br><h3>Tell me more about the scholarships.</h3>
                                    <p>We believe that a student‚Äôs upbringing and financial status should not prevent their participation. Scholarships are available for secondary school applicants from traditionally underrepresented groups in medicine, or who are in financial need. If you believe you fit within these categories, please contact us at <u><a href="mailto:team@nightingale.org.au">team@nightingale.org.au</a></u> for further scholarship application details, and we will consider your situation on a case-by-case basis. We will be working with community partners across the state to ensure a diverse range of applicants and participants, so let us know if you heard about our program from our partners!</p>

                                    <br><h3>Can parents sit in as observers?</h3>
                                    <p>Unfortunately not. Parents are invited and strongly encouraged to attend presentations on the final day of class, where Nightingale Fellows will present their ideas on how the Australian healthcare system could be improved, as well as a graduation ceremony following the presentations.</p>
                                    <br><h3>Is the location wheelchair accessible?  </h3>
                                    <p>Yes. We strive to support full participation for students with disabilities and have selected a venue which is wheelchair accessible. If there are any questions regarding any additional services that may be required, please do not hesitate to contact us at <u><a href="mailto:team@nightingale.org.au">team@nightingale.org.au</a></u></p>
                                    <br><h3>I am 14 and a half years old. Can I still apply? </h3>
                                    <p>The program has a minimum age requirement of 15 years at the program start date (i.e. your birth date must be on or before 28/06/2005). However, we recognise that age may not accurately indicate maturity and intellect. If you do not meet the age requirement but would like to be involved in this program, please contact us at <u><a href="mailto:team@nightingale.org.au">team@nightingale.org.au</a></u></p>
                                    <br><h3>I am in university and this program sounds great. Can I apply? </h3>
                                    <p>Yes. Although the program is designed for high school students, we will allow recent high-school graduates (only in first and second year) to apply for the program as we recognise that the program's integrated curriculum is relatively unique in Australia and can be a large benefit for entry to graduate medical school. We may look to develop a program designed for university students in later years.</p>
