                            We have designed the program to be a powerful head-start into any medical or healthcare career.
                            During the program, you will get to learn real clinical medicine in a safe, hands-on environment, 
                            learn how to think about real medical problems, and work in teams to develop and present 
                            a solution to some of Australia's top medical experts.

                        <p>
                            During the program, we will be holding a Q+A session with our teaching staff for tips on medical school entry, 
                            covering interviews, UCAT/GAMSAT and medical school applications. After the program, you will join a 
                            Nightingale Alumni Society (we call it the Nightingale Family!), where you'll have exclusive access to 
                            new programs, teaching opportunities and external opportunities that come our way.

                                    <br><h3>What will you cover in the program? </h3>
                                    <p>We will cover a broad range of technical topics, including clinical medicine (anatomy, physiology, diseases, clinical skills, medical ethics), public health (health economics, preventative healthcare, health systems) and medical technology (medical devices, biotechnology, digital health, healthcare operations). </p>
                                    <br><p>These will form the foundation for a group project and presentation which will impart an intuition about how to solve healthcare issues and how to present these ideas to an expert audience. We will strive to provide a supportive environment for all fellows and guide students on how to effectively and independently learn and complete field research.</p>
                                    <br><h3>Who will be teaching?</h3>
                                    <p>All teaching material has been developed under the guidance of trained medical doctors, public health specialists and biomedical engineers. The teaching team is a mix of working professionals (i.e. clinicians, engineers, public health specialists) and talented final-year university students.</p>
                                    <br><h3>Do I need to know any specific knowledge before starting the program?</h3>
                                    <p>No. If selected, we do expect a certain level of maturity and independence in managing your own learning. You will be pushed out of your comfort zone as a lot of the things you learn will include actual clinical medicine and the application of real-life skills, but in the safest environment possible. We do not expect prior knowledge in these fields and your genuine participation and effort during the program is more important than prior knowledge. </p>
                                    <br><h3>What is the anticipated workload?</h3>
                                    <p>Fellows will be provided pre-readings, a take-home quiz at the half-way mark, and work in teams on a presentation to recommend an improvement to the current Australian healthcare system. We anticipate the study load to be slightly higher than the average Year 10 workload (closer to Year 11), but the majority of this time will be spent on hands-on field research, project organisation and presentation preparation, rather than assigned homework, textbook exercises and tests.</p>
                                    <br><p>We realise that holidays should be a time for rest and relaxation, but also recognise that carefully crafted assessments can be extremely effective in learning. We have designed our assessments to foster creativity, teamwork, organisation, communication skills and confidence in tackling difficult problems in Australian society. You will be learning carefully curated knowledge so that you can start to solve important healthcare issues (and will do so) within the span of 2 weeks. We think these projects are much more fun and a far better experience than doing exams, textbook exercises, etc.</p>
                                    <br><h3>Who has developed the program?</h3>
                                    <p>The program has been developed through the tireless work and support of several Victorian doctors, public health specialists, talented final year medical students and engineers. The Institute itself was founded by a group of Australians with expertise in medicine, law and engineering.</p>
                                    <br><h3>Will I receive grades for the course? </h3>
                                    <p>No. We believe that grades can lead to unnecessary stress and competition for students and may prohibit greater cohesion and collaboration on projects. Besides, it is difficult to correlate grades with an open-ended project, and final presentations will be judged by medical education and industry leaders based on real-world feasibility. It is our goal that all projects pass this threshold so students will be strongly encouraged to help each other to learn and succeed. The Institute will provide seed funding for unusually exceptional project ideas. </p>
                                    <br><h3>What support will be provided after the program? </h3>
                                    <p>Nightingale Fellows will join an alumni network that aims to connect future Australian innovators. The Institute will provide seed funding for unusually exceptional project ideas and outstanding graduates may be invited for future teaching and program development opportunities. Fellows are welcome to attend new programs and will have a small advantage (about 3-5%) in their application for future programs. </p>
                                    <br><h3>What does the fee cover? </h3>
                                    <p>The fee covers all teaching staff and guidance, teaching material, venue hire and food and drink on all days. A significant proportion of the fees paid will contribute to scholarships for students in financial need or from underrepresented backgrounds in medicine to ensure a diverse range of participants.</p>
                                    <br><h3>Will this program help me get into medicine?</h3>
                                    <p>We recognise the difficulty of getting into medical school. Our program will provide real-world frameworks, insights and experiences that may be invaluable for medical school interviews and teach you crucial real-life skills so you can independently manage your learning and build your own medical projects. The content you will cover is identical to what you should expect to cover in any medical school, and you will be challenged with ethical and technical dilemmas that innovative clinicians face. In other words, you will learn how to think like a medical doctor and an innovative healthcare leader. We also have dedicated a time in the program for fellows to be introduced about the different pathways into medicine and for them to receive tips and advice from students who have successfully been accepted into medical school, which will assist them in the interview, UCAT/GAMSAT and application process.</p>
                                    <br><h3>Is this program only for students aspiring to become medical doctors? </h3>
                                    <p>Absolutely not. Whilst we expect a certain proportion of participants to have a strong interest in clinical medicine or surgery as a career, the field of medicine is driven by individuals from extremely diverse backgrounds - nurses, biologists, engineers, economists, physiotherapists, pharmacists, artists, lawyers, managers and so on. Understanding clinical knowledge and how doctors think is useful for many occupations separate from healthcare, and our team firmly believes that this diversity is extremely important in creating novel solutions and is a goal of the Nightingale Institute.</p>
                                    <br><h3>The program seems really intense and I’m not sure if I can handle it. Should I still apply? </h3>
                                    <p>Yes. Our team firmly believes that anyone can learn anything they sincerely put effort towards. We have worked very hard to ensure that the program is as accessible as possible, and as long as you are willing to work hard and put in the time, we expect you to excel within this program. If selected, we believe you have enough academic maturity to tackle the program and we will strive to create a supportive environment to help you succeed.</p>
                                    <br><h3>Can I attend only part of the program? </h3>
                                    <p>Unfortunately, fellows are expected to attend the entire program. Because the program covers a lot of ground within 8 days, it can be difficult to catch up and contribute meaningfully to the final project if you miss more than 2 days of classes. If you anticipate that you will be away for more than 2 days, we would recommend applying for the Summer 2021 program. Classes will only run from Monday to Thursday (no classes on Friday).</p>
                                    <br><h3>Will you have more programs in the future?</h3>
                                    <p>Yes! As there is quite a lot to learn in this area, we are developing new medical programs and we expect that no new program will be identical to previous ones. At this stage, we are developing a new medical fellowship for Summer 2021, which will cover a different area of clinical medicine and present a fresh, new challenge for Fellows. We are also currently looking to expand into programs for university students with more advanced content and across different disciplines in the coming years.</p>

                                    <br><h3>When/where will the program be held?</h3>
                                    <p>The program will be held in Docklands, Victoria from Monday 29th of June to Thursday 9th of July. The location is approximately 2 minutes walk from the closest tram stop. Classes will be held Monday to Thursday 9am - 4pm (no classes on Friday). Further information will be sent to selected Nightingale Fellows. </p>
                                    <br><h3>Will food be provided?</h3>
                                    <p>Yes. A light morning tea and lunch will be provided for participants every day, including for those with special dietary requirements. On the last day, this will be extended to canapés and light refreshments for attendees of the presentation and graduation ceremony.</p>

                                    <br><h3>What is the application process? </h3>
                                    <p>Students are asked to fill out a form that asks for some basic information and 3 short-answer questions, so that we can get a better idea of who you are and how you think. No references, school reports or interviews are required. The application is due on the 30th of April 2020 at 11:59pm. Late applications will not be considered.</p>
                                    <br><p>The questions can be tricky and we recommend starting early to give yourself enough time to think about them. It could also help to bounce ideas off your family and friends, but we want the answer to be written only by you.</p>
                                    <br><h3>When will I hear back? Will assessments in blinded?</h3>
                                    <p>We strive to have a fast turnaround time and you will hear back from us within the first week of May. As is standard practice in many industries, all Nightingale assessments are blinded, so reviewers won’t know your name or details when they assess your responses. This helps us prevent any potential biases and promotes diversity.</p>
                                    <br><h3>What type of candidate are you looking for?</h3>
                                    <p>We are seeking candidates with a high potential to contribute meaningfully to the future of medicine and a capacity to think creatively about important healthcare issues and potential solutions. We won't be looking at how you're going in school and academic maturity and genuine interest are valued more highly. </p>
                                    <br><p>In other words, if you are passionate about improving healthcare and really want to learn how to do so, we would love to hear from you.</p>
                                    <br><h3>How competitive is the application process? </h3>
                                    <p>Unfortunately, we expect many more capable candidates than available Nightingale Fellowships. We do not set a strict limit on the number of available positions but our team will set an approximate upper bound every cycle to ensure the quality of our program for selected Fellows. If you are not selected, we strongly encourage you to apply in the next cycle. Applications for the January 2021 program will close at the end of October 2020. Previous applications have no bearing on whether you’ll be selected in the next round.</p>

                                    <br><h3>Tell me more about the scholarships.</h3>
                                    <p>We believe that a student’s upbringing and financial status should not prevent their participation. We have made a limited number of scholarships available for secondary school applicants from traditionally underrepresented groups in medicine, or who are in financial need. If you believe you fit within these categories, please contact us at team@nightingale.org.au for further scholarship application details, and we will consider your situation on a case-by-case basis. We will be working with community partners across the state to ensure a diverse range of applicants and participants, so let us know if you heard about our program from our partners!</p>

                                    <br><h3>Can parents sit in as observers?</h3>
                                    <p>Unfortunately not. Parents are invited and strongly encouraged to attend presentations on the final day of class, where Nightingale Fellows will present their ideas on how the Australian healthcare system could be improved, as well as a graduation ceremony following the presentations.</p>
                                    <br><h3>Will the program be recorded? </h3>
                                    <p>Unfortunately not. We will consider this in later iterations of the course but have no plans currently to record the content. Besides, many sessions are designed to be interactive rather than didactic and we expect the live experience will be far better than watching recordings.</p>
                                    <br><h3>Is the location wheelchair accessible?  </h3>
                                    <p>Yes. We strive to support full participation for students with disabilities and have selected a venue which is wheelchair accessible. If there are any questions regarding any additional services that may be required, please do not hesitate to contact us at team@nightingale.org.au</p>
                                    <br><h3>I am 14 and a half years old. Can I still apply? </h3>
                                    <p>The program has a minimum age requirement of 15 years at the program start date (i.e. your birth date must be on or before 28/06/2005). However, we recognise that age may not accurately indicate maturity and intellect. If you do not meet the age requirement but would like to be involved in this program, please contact us at team@nightingale.org.au</p>
                                    <br><h3>I am in university and this program sounds great. Can I apply? </h3>
                                    <p>Yes. Although the program is designed for high school students, we will allow recent high-school graduates (only in first and second year) to apply for the program as we recognise that the program's integrated curriculum is relatively unique in Australia and can be a large benefit for entry to graduate medical school. We may look to develop a program designed for university students in later years.</p>
